# Credit Risk Prediction

This project involves building and evaluating machine learning models to predict credit risk using the German Credit dataset. The goal is to classify individuals as good or bad credit risks based on various financial and demographic attributes.

## Overview

- **Dataset**: [German Credit Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/german-credit)  
- **Objective**: Predict whether a loan applicant is a good or bad credit risk  
- **Techniques Used**:
  - Data cleaning and transformation
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  - Model training and evaluation

## Data Exploration

Key steps in the exploratory phase included:
- Handling missing or inconsistent values
- Visualizing feature distributions using histograms
- Identifying relationships using a correlation heatmap
- Detecting outliers using boxplots

## Tools & Libraries

- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- XGBoost
- Matplotlib

## Models Used

Three classification models were built and compared:
- **Logistic Regression**
- **Decision Tree**
- **XGBoost Classifier**

Each model was evaluated using metrics such as:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Confusion Matrix

## Results

The models were compared based on predictive performance, with a focus on balancing precision and accuracy. XGBoost generally performed the best, showing stronger predictive power without significant overfitting.

## Notes

- This project is intended as a portfolio piece for internship applications in data analytics and finance.
- Dataset is publicly available from Kaggle.
